This is my portifolio. I made it with Vue.JS 3 and quasar. For the email i used the library emailJS. Here is the URL: https://pedropaulocg.surge.sh/#/


## Install the dependencies
```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```
