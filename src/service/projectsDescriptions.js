  currencyBot: {
    description: "Starting on my personal projects, this was a whatsapp bot to convert the price of any currency to BRL. I made this bot so i could monitor the price of the euro in BRL. But how it works? You can enter in the list of a currency and the bot will message you every day at 8am 12pm and 6pm (Brazil's timezone) the price off it. You also put a value so if the price reach it will notify you. I used javascript and to connect to the whatsapp i used whatsapp-web.js library. In the database i used MySQL. This project was also to practice my knowledge of doing whatsapp bots and understand better who the library works so i can undertand better the clickmassa features. If you want to give it a try just send a whatsapp message to +55 84 991576855. Or just click in this button",
